# FLIP Rules

**Flip** is a strategic change-making game using ten 6-sided dice.
To Begin: Each player rolls five 6-sided dice. The player who rolls the lowest total goes first. From here forward, the dice are never rolled again.

**On Each Turn:** You must do one of two things. You may either flip over one of your own dice, or you may instruct your opponent to play one of his dice into the middle of the table.

**Flipping:** The top and bottom numbers of 6-sided dice always sum to 7. If your dice are not set up like this, treat them as if they were. In other words, when you flip a 6 it must become a 1, whenyouflipa3itmustbecomea4,andsoon.
The object of flipping a die is usually to make it show a bigger number, though there are some strategic reasons to flip large dice down.

**Playing:** Choose one of your opponentâ€™s dice. Your opponent must put that die into the middle of the table. He may then withdraw any combination of dice from the middle which totals less than the value of the die he put in. So, for example, if he plays a 5 into the middle, he could take up to 4 points worth of dice in any combination.
The object of instructing your opponent to play a die is to run him out of dice. However, you should probably not do this if he will take back more dice than he plays.

**Forbidden Moves:** To avoid stalemate, it is illegal to flip the same die twice without first making your opponent play a die.

**Winning:** To win the game, you must be the last player with any dice left. To keep score over several games, record the total pips showing on the dice you keep, and play to 50 points.
